kriging, also known as Gaussian process regression, is a method of interpolation based on Gaussian process governed by prior covariances. Under suitable assumptions of the prior, kriging gives the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) at unsampled locations.

Spatial interpolation is a class of estimation problems where
 locations with known values are used to estimate values at
 other locations, with an emphasis on harnessing spatial lo
cality and trends.
